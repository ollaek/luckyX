                      We collect information you provide directly to us. For
                      example, we collect information when you create an
                      account, subscribe, participate in any interactive
                      features of our services, fill out a form, request
                      customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The
                      types of information we may collect include your name,
                      email address, postal address, credit card information and

                      We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the
                      Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we
                      collect information like web requests, the data sent in
                      response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address,
                      the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp
                      for the request.

                      We also use various technologies to collect information,
                      and this may include sending cookies to your computer.
                      Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or
                      in your device memory that helps us to improve our
                      services and your experience, see which areas and features
                      of our services are popular and count visits. We may also
                      collect information using web beacons (also known as
                      "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic images that
                      may be used in our services or emails and to track count
                      visits or understand usage and campaign effectiveness.
